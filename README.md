Please not that these files are a work in progress and not a complete tutorial. They are subject to change. I plan to create designs
for Cube Orbs using 4x4, 5x5 and 8x8 LED matrices. Currently, only the 4x4 one is relatively complete. It is a challenging (but fun!)
project. Good soldering and wire management skills are essential for success.
