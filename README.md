# Cube Orb Project

This project is a fun (and challenging) build to create a sphere (orb) out of square LED matrices arranged in a cube. 
The six lofted 3D printed sides of the sphere pipe the light out from the LEDs to the surface of the sphere. You can
buy square WS2812 LED matrices in 4x4, 5x5 and 8x8 sizes easily on Amazon and AliExpress. I plan to publish design files
for all three sizes, but currently only the 4x4 one is relatively complete.

Please note that Cube Orb is a work in progress. It is not a step-by-step tutorial, though I am including as much information as I can
for anyone who wishes to try the build themselves. Good soldering and wire managment skills are strongly recommended if you make the
attempt. Good luck!
