Please note that these files are a work in progress and not a complete tutorial. The design files are subject to change. Designs
are planned for Cube Orbs using 4x4, 5x5 and 8x8 LED matrices. Currently, only the [Orb4x4](./Orb4x4/) design is complete. It is a challenging (but fun!)
project requiring good soldering and wire management skills to succeed. Good luck and have fun with it!
