# CubeSphere
Design files and code for a 3D printed shell to transform an LED cube to a sphere. This is a work in progress and the documentation and design are not complete yet. Use at your own peril.

Currently the assembly is held together with string wrapped around the parts of the shell to hold them against the matrices.
